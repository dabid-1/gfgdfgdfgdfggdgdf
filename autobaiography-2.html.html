        <p>
          My name is Allen Loi D. Cabasag, and I was born on November 29,2006 in the town of Macanaya Aparri Cagayan, We are  three Siblings of Lerma D. Cabasag and Allan D. Cabasag. Growing up as their three Siblings,
          I have been surrounded with love, care, and constant guidance. My parents have always been my source of strength and inspiration, and because of them, I learned to value discipline, hard work, and respect for others.
           From a young age, I discovered my interest in different activities, especially in sports. One sport that captured my heart is Basketball. At first, it was simply a hobby, but as time passed it became a passion and an 
           important part of my identity Basketball has not only strengthened my body but also shaped my character.Through the sport, learned valuable lessons such as respect, perseverance, and mental toughness.
          <br><br>
          Every training session taught me that success does not happen overnight-a comes through sercat, sacrifice, and determination in 2023, was given the opportunity to represent my school and community as a participant In the 
          CAPITAL TOWN For me this was a great honor became not everyone in given the chance to weve a uniforms and compete on behalf of eir school and hometown That experience remains unforgettable because it taught me the true meaning of 
          being an athlete-not just to fight for medals but to represent the spirit of teamwork, pride, and resilience More than winning, the lessons I gained and the experience I shared with my teammates and opponents are what I value most.
          Aside from sports, take my studies seriously I strongly believe that Education is the key to unlocking a better future. It gives you the power to dream big and the skills to turn those dreams into reality
          <br><br>
          Through education, you gain knowledge, confidence, and the ability to make meaningful contributions to the world around you. 
          It's not just about learning facts; it's about discovering new ideas, solving problems, and thinking critically.
          Education helps you understand the world, respect different perspectives, and grow as a person. It builds character, shapes your values, and opens doors to endless opportunities.
          Education also creates a ripple effect. When you learn, you inspire those around you, and together, you can build a brighter, more informed society. It's an investment in yourself and the future.
